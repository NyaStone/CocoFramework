# CocoFramework

This project is a reimplementation of my previous bot project CoconutBot that was discontinued due to breaking changes in the API, as well as discord implementing natively most features the bot offered.

The goal of this reimplementation is to not leave discord communities hanging that have grown dependent on the administration tools the previous bot offered.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS and your prefered SQL database.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the dependencies with ` npm install `.
4. Compile the TypeScript with ` npx tsc `.
5. Copy and rename [config.example.json](config.example.json) to config.json and fill it with environment info.
6. Start up the bot using ` node main.js `.

You're ready to go !
